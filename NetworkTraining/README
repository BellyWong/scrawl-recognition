The training makes use of the neural network package (obviously).
The package can be found here: https://github.com/stevejarvis/neural-network

There seems to be incompatibilities between Python2.7 and Python3.x when it
comes to "shelving" things. Python3 saves the database with a ".db" extension,
which will not work with the app. Also, Python3 cannot read database files
created by Python2.7. Whenever possible I will make this run with either
interpreter, but because 2.7 is installed on euclid.nmu.edu, where this
will eventually be run, all incompatibilities like this will be developed
for 2.7.
