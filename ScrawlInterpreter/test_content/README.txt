In the *sections folder are simple ink tests to develop the java
package. The folder name indicates the number of sections which
should be used to evaluate the image. The images inside are named
for the sections that should be returned as containing ink, separated
by underscores.

e.g. 25_sections/1_5_.png should be evaluated using 25 sections
and should show that sections 1 and 5 contain ink.
