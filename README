This is a project to recognize handwritten digits by use of a neural network.

This repository contains the iOS front end, the Python application used to train
the network and any other pieces needed to make this work.

The neural network is added as a submodule and must be pulled with 'git 
submodule update'.

GLPaint: iOS application for demonstration
NetworkTraining: Application that teaches the MNIST database to the network
Site: Web interface for query from GLPaint
