This is a project to recognize handwritten digits by use of a neural network.

This repository contains the Android front end, the Python application used to train
the network, the Java library used to interpret the input from Android, and any
other pieces needed to make this work.

... Except the neural network. It has its own repo: https://github.com/stevejarvis/neural-network
