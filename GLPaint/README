##GLPaint##

GLPaint is an example painting application from the Apple Developer site. I
made edits to work for the digit recognition project. In summary, the
edits are these:

Auto recognize end of writing and submit/get results.
Auto erase when finished and prepare for new run.
Add settings for request URL and show grid.
